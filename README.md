# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Progression

## Project Overview

This project aims to help Geely Auto understand the factors affecting car prices in the American market. By building a predictive model, Geely Auto can gain insights into pricing dynamics and make informed decisions about their manufacturing and business strategies.

## Business Goal

The primary business goal is to model the price of cars based on available independent variables. This model will enable Geely Auto's management to:

* Understand the relationship between car features and prices in the US market.
* Identify significant variables that influence car prices.
* Manipulate car design and business strategies to achieve desired price points.
* Gain a better understanding of the pricing dynamics in a new market.

## Data

The dataset used in this project was gathered by an automobile consulting firm through various market surveys. It includes a wide range of car types and their corresponding features, including:

* **CarName:** The make and model of the car.
* **horsepower:** The engine's horsepower.
* **curbweight:** The weight of the car without passengers or cargo.
* **enginesize:** The size of the engine in cubic centimeters.
* **price:** The price of the car.
... (Include other relevant features from the dataset)

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of variables and identify potential relationships.
2. **Feature Selection:** Select relevant features for the model based on their correlation with the target variable (price).
3. **Model Building:** Train a machine learning model, such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, or Lasso Regression, to predict car prices.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
5. **Insights and Recommendations:** Based on the model's results, provide insights and recommendations to Geely Auto regarding pricing strategies and market dynamics.

## Results

* **Significant Variables:** The model identified 'horsepower', 'curbweight', and 'enginesize' as significant predictors of car prices.
* **Model Performance:** The model achieved an R-squared value of [insert R-squared value], indicating a good fit to the data.
* **Pricing Insights:** [Summarize key insights and recommendations derived from the model]

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset and place it in the project directory.
2. Execute the Jupyter Notebook provided.
3. Review the results and analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the factors affecting car prices in the American market. Geely Auto can utilize these findings to inform their business decisions and gain a competitive advantage in the US automotive industry.
